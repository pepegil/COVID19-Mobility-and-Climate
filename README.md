# COVID19 + Mobility + climate


<p>Final project of a Master in Big Data. The work is trying to relate covid-19 pandemic with variables such people mobility trough periods and time and climate conditions. KDD methodology is used through the project</p>

<p>
  The process is divided in three parts. Find, extract and preprocess data.
  Explore data.
  Apply Machine Learning algorithms for prediction.
